This module contains the following functions:
1. Produce the data from lv model equation by LV.py
2. Using odenet to learn the coeficient matrix of LV equation by ode_read_file.py
3. Reconstruct the equation form by Reconstruct.py


The module requires but not limited to the following python packages:
numpy, os, pytorch, sympy ...

There is a lazy-man command:
    python run.py

to run the work.



pnas seems only the small noise works, but the work can deal with big noise
